## 2. PROBLEM FRAMING SECTION

### Section Header
THE CHALLENGE

### Headline
TRADITIONAL PARTICIPATION FAILS

### Description
Ecosystems can't reward what they can't verify.

### Problem Cards

#### Problem 01: FAKE PARTICIPATION
- Description: Tasks completed without real protocol usage. Bots and wash trading create noise instead of meaningful signal.
- Details:
  - Screenshot farming
  - Bot activity
  - No verification layer

#### Problem 02: MANUAL PROOF
- Description: Screenshots, forms, and self-reported activity. No verification layer. Ecosystems forced to trust unverified claims.
- Details:
  - Time-consuming (30+ min)
  - Easily faked
  - No standardization

#### Problem 03: NO PORTABLE REPUTATION
- Description: Your actions don't build long-term on-chain identity. Each campaign starts from zero. No cumulative proof of expertise.
- Details:
  - Zero continuity
  - Repeated verification
  - Lost participation history

## 6. FAQ SECTION

### Section Header
COMMON QUESTIONS

### Headline
Everything You Need to Know

### Questions & Answers

#### Q1: Is verification automatic?
A: Yes. Once you complete an on-chain action, INTENT automatically indexes and verifies it via RPC. No manual submission needed.

#### Q2: How does protocol-level validation work?
A: We query blockchain directly for contract interactions (function calls, events). Not just checking tx hash, but validating actual protocol usage.

#### Q3: Can I use proofs across different campaigns?
A: Yes. Proof NFTs are portable. Once minted, they can be referenced in multiple campaigns and ecosystems.

#### Q4: Is my wallet data private?
A: We only read public on-chain data (transactions, contract interactions). Never access private keys or off-chain data.

#### Q5: What if I want to edit content?
A: You can edit AI-generated captions before posting. Just keep @ArcFlowFinance mention for platform integrity.

#### Q6: Is this only for airdrops?
A: No. INTENT builds verifiable reputation regardless of airdrops. Portfolio proof, network building, and technical learning all have value.
